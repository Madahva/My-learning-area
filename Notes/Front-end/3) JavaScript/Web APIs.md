# Browser APIs

Browser APIs are built into your web browser, and are able to expose data from the surrounding computer environment, or do useful complex things.

## **The DOM** **(Document Object Model)** **API** 

This API allows you to manipulate HTML and CSS, creating, removing and changing HTML, dynamically applying new styles to your page, etc.

## FETCH

This API allows us to make network requests to retrieve resources from a server via JavaScript (e.g. images, text, JSON, even HTML snippets), meaning that we can update small sections of content without having to reload the entire page.


# Third party APIs

Third party APIs are APIs provided by third parties — generally companies such as Facebook, Twitter, or Google — to allow you to access their functionality via JavaScript and use it on your site.

To access them from JavaScript you first need to connect to the API functionality and make it available on your page.

Most APIs require you to use some kind of developer key, for reasons of security and accountability.


## RESTful API

We get data by making HTTP requests to specific URLs, with data like search terms and other properties encoded in the URL (often as URL parameters). This is a common pattern you'll encounter with APIs.
