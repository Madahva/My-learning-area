# What is an Element in HTML?
An HTML element is a component of an HTML document that tells a web browser how to structure and interpret a part of the HTML document.


## Attributes

HTML attribute is a modifier of HTML element. Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. Attributes are always specified in the start tag of an element, after the element's name.


## Empty Elements

HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.

e.g. The `<br>` tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag


# Basic structure

An HTML document is composed of four parts: a line containing HTML version information, a declarative header section (delimited by the **HEAD** element), a **body**, which contains the document's actual content and the HTML tag that wraps the head and body, It is the root of the document.


## Head

It defines the head of an HTML document that contains non-visible data like metadata. Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.


## Body

The `<body>` tag defines the document's body. The `<body>` element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
