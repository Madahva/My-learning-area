# Semantic

Semantic HTML elements are those that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. 

Semantically correct HTML helps search engines, screen readers, and other user devices determine the significance and context of web content. It certainly will make your code more accessible, making it easier to read.

Elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>` and `<footer>` are all considered semantic because they accurately describe the purpose of the element and the type of content that is inside them.
