# Forms

An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.

The HTML `<form>` element is used to create an HTML form for user input.

It can contain the **input**, **label**, **button**, **textarea** and others elements.

## Input tag

The `<input>` tag specifies an input field where the user can enter data. The `<input>` element can be displayed in several ways, depending on the type attribute.

**E.g.**

Displays a single-line text input field
`<input type="text">`	

Displays a radio button (for selecting one of many choices)
`<input type="radio">`	

Displays a checkbox (for selecting zero or more of many choices)
`<input type="checkbox">`	

Displays a submit button (for submitting the form)
`<input type="submit">`	

Displays a clickable button
`<input type="button">`
