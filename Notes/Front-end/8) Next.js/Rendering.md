The world of web development is filled with complexities, and understanding how rendering works in the context of Next.js is crucial. In this blog post, we'll delve into the intricacies of rendering, exploring different environments, strategies, and runtimes.

### The Fundamentals

Before we dive into the specifics of rendering in Next.js, it's essential to grasp three foundational web concepts:

#### Rendering Environments

The first concept to understand is the rendering environment. In web development, there are two primary environments where your application code can be executed: the **client** and the **server**. The client is essentially the user's web browser, responsible for requesting and rendering your application, while the server is a remote computer that stores and processes your application code, responding to client requests.

Historically, web developers had to use different languages and frameworks when coding for the client and server. However, React, and platforms like Next.js, have changed the game by enabling developers to use the same language (JavaScript) and the same framework for both environments.

This flexibility eliminates the need for context switching and allows developers to seamlessly write code for both the client and server. Nevertheless, it's important to note that each environment has its own capabilities and constraints, leading to differences in the code written for each.

#### Request-Response Lifecycle

Every web application follows a common Request-Response Lifecycle:

1. **User Action:** The user interacts with the web application, triggering an action like clicking a link, submitting a form, or entering a URL.

2. **HTTP Request:** The client sends an HTTP request to the server, specifying what resources it needs and the HTTP method to use.

3. **Server:** The server processes the request, which may involve routing, fetching data, and more.

4. **HTTP Response:** After processing, the server sends back an HTTP response containing a status code and the requested resources (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

5. **Client:** The client parses the received resources and renders the user interface.

6. **User Action:** With the user interface now displayed, the user can interact with the application, initiating the process again.

Understanding where to split the work in this lifecycle and where to place the Network Boundary is essential when building hybrid web applications.

#### Network Boundary

The Network Boundary is a conceptual line that separates different environments in web development, such as the client and server. In React, you have the flexibility to decide where this boundary should be placed based on your application's needs.

Behind the scenes, your application is divided into two parts: the **client module graph** and the **server module graph**. The server module graph includes components rendered on the server, while the client module graph contains components rendered on the client. These module graphs visually represent how files in your application depend on each other.

To define this boundary in React, you can use the `"use client"` and `"use server"` conventions, which inform React about where specific computational work should occur.

### Building Hybrid Applications

When developing in these environments, it's helpful to visualize the flow of your application code as unidirectional, flowing from the server to the client during a response. If you need to access the server from the client, you initiate a new request rather than reusing an existing one. This approach simplifies the decision-making process regarding where to render components and where to place the Network Boundary.

In practice, this unidirectional model encourages developers to consider what should be executed on the server before making the application interactive on the client. This concept becomes even clearer when exploring how you can interleave client and server components within the same component tree.

Understanding these fundamental concepts of rendering, request-response lifecycles, and network boundaries is crucial for harnessing the power of React and Next.js effectively. Stay tuned for deeper insights into server and client components in Next.js as we continue to explore this fascinating world of web development.

## Rendering

By default, Next.js pre-renders every page. This means that Next.js _generates HTML for each page in advance_, instead of having it all done by client-side JavaScript. Pre-rendering can result in better performance and [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization).

Each generated HTML is associated with minimal JavaScript code necessary for that page. When a page is loaded by the browser, its JavaScript code runs and makes the page fully interactive. (This process is called **hydration**.)


With Next.js, three types of rendering methods are available: **Server-Side Rendering**, **Static Site Generation**, and **Client-Side Rendering**.

### Pre-Rendering

Server-Side Rendering and Static Site Generation are also referred to as **Pre-Rendering** because the fetching of external data and transformation of React components into HTML happens before the result is sent to the client. Pre-rendering means the HTML is generated in advance, on a server, instead of having it all done by JavaScript on the user's device.


#### Server-Side Rendering

With server-side rendering, the HTML of the page is generated on a server for **each** request. The generated HTML, JSON data, and JavaScript instructions to make the page interactive are then sent to the client.

On the client, the HTML is used to show a fast non-interactive page, while React uses the JSON data and JavaScript instructions to make components interactive (for example, attaching event handlers to a button). This process is called **hydration**.

#### Static Site Generation

With Static Site Generation, the HTML is generated on the server, but unlike server-side rendering, there is no server at runtime. Instead, content is generated once, at build time, when the application is deployed, and the HTML is stored in a [CDN](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/how-nextjs-works/cdns-and-edge) and re-used for each request.

### Client-Side Rendering

In a standard React application, the browser receives an empty HTML shell from the server along with the JavaScript instructions to construct the UI. This is called **client-side rendering** because the initial rendering work happens on the user's device.

### When to Use Static Generation v.s. Server-side Rendering

We recommend using [**Static Generation**](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended) (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.

You can use [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended) for many types of pages, including:

- Marketing pages
- Blog posts
- E-commerce product listings
- Help and documentation

You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended).

On the other hand, [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended) is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.

In that case, you can use [**Server-side Rendering**](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering). It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate frequently updated data.

# React Server Components

The world of web development is constantly evolving, and one of the latest advancements is the introduction of React Server Components in Next.js. These components open up a world of possibilities by allowing you to render parts of your application on the server. In this blog post, we'll explore the ins and outs of React Server Components, why you might want to use them, and the various server rendering strategies they bring to the table.

### The Benefits of Server Rendering

Before diving into the specifics, let's understand why server rendering is such a game-changer:

#### 1. Data Fetching

Server Components enable you to move data fetching to the server, bringing your data closer to the source. This not only improves performance by reducing data retrieval time but also minimizes the number of requests sent from the client.

#### 2. Security

Sensitive data and logic can be safely kept on the server, away from prying eyes on the client side. Tokens, API keys, and other confidential information remain secure.

#### 3. Caching

Server rendering allows results to be cached and reused across users and subsequent requests. This optimization enhances performance and cuts down on rendering and data fetching costs.

#### 4. Bundle Sizes

Server Components let you keep large dependencies on the server, sparing clients from downloading, parsing, and executing hefty JavaScript files. This benefits users with slower internet connections or less powerful devices.

#### 5. Initial Page Load and First Contentful Paint

Server rendering generates HTML on the server, enabling users to view the page immediately without waiting for client-side JavaScript to load. This improves the critical "First Contentful Paint" metric.

#### 6. SEO and Social Network Shareability

Rendered HTML is invaluable for search engines to index your pages and for social networks to generate previews when your content is shared.

#### 7. Streaming

Server Components empower you to split rendering into manageable chunks and stream them to the client as they become available. Users get to see parts of the page sooner without waiting for the entire rendering process to complete.

### Using Server Components in Next.js

The good news is that Next.js leverages Server Components by default. This means you can effortlessly implement server rendering without additional configuration. You can even opt for Client Components when the situation demands it.

### How Server Components Work

Server Components work their magic by orchestrating rendering on the server. The rendering process is divided into chunks, both by individual route segments and Suspense Boundaries, following these steps:

1. React renders Server Components into a specialized data format called the React Server Component Payload (RSC Payload).

2. Next.js takes this RSC Payload and JavaScript instructions for Client Components to render HTML on the server.

On the client side:

1. The HTML is used to provide a fast, non-interactive preview of the route during the initial page load.

2. The React Server Component Payload is employed to reconcile Client and Server Component trees, updating the DOM.

3. The JavaScript instructions hydrate Client Components, making the application fully interactive.

### Server Rendering Strategies

Server Components introduce three distinct rendering strategies:

#### 1. Static Rendering (Default)

Static Rendering involves rendering routes at build time or in the background after data revalidation. The results can be cached and pushed to a Content Delivery Network (CDN). This approach is ideal for routes with non-personalized, pre-known data, like static blog posts or product pages.

#### 2. Dynamic Rendering

Dynamic Rendering shifts the rendering process to request time, ensuring that each user gets a personalized experience. This is essential when routes depend on user-specific data, cookies, or URL parameters.

#### 3. Streaming

Streaming is a revolutionary approach where routes are rendered on the server at request time and then streamed to the client in chunks. This allows users to view a preview of the page before it's fully rendered, making it perfect for lower-priority UI elements or data fetches that may be slower.

Choosing between these strategies is made easier by Next.js, which automatically selects the best approach for each route based on your application's features and APIs.

In essence, React Server Components in Next.js represent a groundbreaking shift in server-side rendering, offering a plethora of benefits, rendering strategies, and the flexibility to cater to your application's unique needs. Whether you're concerned about performance, security, or SEO, Server Components have you covered. Stay tuned for more insights into the exciting world of web development with Next.js.

"Mastering Client Components in Next.js: Interactive Rendering at Your Fingertips"

Client Components are a game-changer in the world of web development, offering the power to render interactive UI components on the client side. In this guide, we'll explore what Client Components are, why you might want to use them, how they work, and when to opt for this rendering approach in Next.js.

### Why Choose Client Rendering?

Client rendering brings a slew of benefits to the table, making it an attractive option for various scenarios:

#### 1. Interactivity

Client Components are capable of using state, effects, and event listeners. This means they can provide immediate feedback to users and dynamically update the user interface, creating a seamless and interactive experience.

#### 2. Browser APIs

Client Components grant access to browser APIs like geolocation or localStorage. This access allows you to build tailored UI components for specific use cases, leveraging the full power of the client's environment.

### How to Use Client Components in Next.js

Using Client Components in Next.js is an opt-in process, meaning you explicitly specify which components should be rendered on the client. Here's how to do it:

1. Add the React `"use client"` directive at the top of your file, above your imports.

   ```jsx
   'use client'

   import { useState } from 'react'

   export default function Counter() {
     // Component logic here
   }
   ```

   This directive declares a boundary between Server and Client Component modules, instructing React to render the components specified under it on the client side.

2. Once you define the boundary with `"use client"`, all modules imported into that file, including child components, are considered part of the client bundle and will be rendered on the client.

### Rendering Client Components

In Next.js, Client Components can be rendered differently depending on whether the request is part of a full page load (initial visit or browser refresh) or a subsequent navigation.

#### Full Page Load

To optimize the initial page load, Next.js renders static HTML previews for both Client and Server Components using React's APIs. This means users see the page's content immediately during their first visit, without waiting for client-side JavaScript to load.

1. React renders Server Components into a specialized format called the React Server Component Payload (RSC Payload), including references to Client Components.

2. Next.js utilizes the RSC Payload and Client Component JavaScript instructions to generate HTML for the route on the server.

On the client side:

1. The HTML provides a fast, non-interactive initial preview of the route.

2. The React Server Components Payload is used to reconcile the Client and Server Component trees and update the DOM.

3. JavaScript instructions hydrate Client Components, making them fully interactive.

#### Subsequent Navigations

During subsequent navigations, Client Components are entirely rendered on the client without server-rendered HTML. This means the Client Component JavaScript bundle is downloaded, parsed, and executed. React then uses the RSC Payload to reconcile the Client and Server Component trees and update the DOM.

### Switching Between Client and Server

Sometimes, you may need to transition between the client and server environments even after defining the `"use client"` boundary. For instance, you might want to minimize the client bundle size, fetch data on the server, or utilize server-specific APIs.

To achieve this, you can seamlessly interleave Client Components and Server Components, along with Server Actions. This flexibility allows you to adapt your rendering strategy to the specific needs of your application.

In summary, Client Components open up exciting possibilities for creating interactive and dynamic user interfaces. By understanding when and how to use them in Next.js, you can take your web development projects to the next level, providing users with fast, responsive, and engaging experiences.

# Exploring Server and Client Composition Patterns in React

When diving into the world of building React applications, one crucial consideration is determining which parts of your application should be rendered on the server and which should reside on the client. In this article, we'll explore recommended composition patterns when working with Server and Client Components in React.

## When to Use Server and Client Components?

Before delving into the composition patterns, it's essential to understand when to use Server and Client Components. Here's a quick summary of the use cases for each:

- **Server Component**:
  - ✅ Fetch data.
  - ✅ Access backend resources directly.
  - ✅ Keep sensitive information on the server (e.g., access tokens, API keys).
  - ✅ Keep large dependencies on the server to reduce client-side JavaScript.
  - ❌ Add interactivity and event listeners (e.g., `onClick()`, `onChange()`).
  - ❌ Use State and Lifecycle Effects (e.g., `useState()`, `useReducer()`, `useEffect()`).
  - ❌ Use browser-only APIs.
  - ❌ Use custom hooks dependent on state, effects, or browser-only APIs.
  - ❌ Use [React Class components](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component).

- **Client Component**:
  - ❌ Fetch data.
  - ❌ Access backend resources directly.
  - ❌ Keep sensitive information on the server (e.g., access tokens, API keys).
  - ❌ Keep large dependencies on the server to reduce client-side JavaScript.
  - ✅ Add interactivity and event listeners (e.g., `onClick()`, `onChange()`).
  - ✅ Use State and Lifecycle Effects (e.g., `useState()`, `useReducer()`, `useEffect()`).
  - ✅ Use browser-only APIs.
  - ✅ Use custom hooks dependent on state, effects, or browser-only APIs.
  - ✅ Use [React Class components](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component).

Now, let's explore some composition patterns for Server and Client Components.

## Server Component Patterns

### Sharing Data Between Components

When working with Server Components, you may need to share data across different components. For example, you might have a layout and a page that both rely on the same data. Instead of using React Context (which isn't available on the server) or passing data as props, you can leverage the `fetch` function or React's `cache` function.

React automatically memoizes data requests made with `fetch`, and the `cache` function can be used when `fetch` isn't available. This ensures that components fetching the same data won't make duplicate requests, making your application more efficient. [Learn more about memoization](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#request-memoization) in React.

### Keeping Server-only Code Isolated

It's possible for server-only code to find its way into client modules since JavaScript modules are shared between Server and Client Components. To prevent this, you can use the `server-only` package. This package helps catch errors during the build process if server-only code is imported into a Client Component.

To use `server-only`, follow these steps:

1. Install the package: `npm install server-only`.
2. Import the package into any module containing server-only code.
3. Mark the module as server-only by importing `'server-only'`.

This ensures that any Client Component importing a server-only module will trigger a build-time error, helping maintain the separation between server and client code.

### Using Third-party Packages and Providers

When working with Server Components, keep in mind that not all third-party packages and providers in the React ecosystem are equipped to handle server rendering. Some packages may lack the `"use client"` directive, making them incompatible with Server Components.

For such cases, you can wrap third-party components that rely on client-only features in your own Client Components. This ensures that these components work as expected within your Server Components.

### Using Context Providers

Context providers play a crucial role in sharing global concerns, like themes, within your application. However, React Context is not supported in Server Components. To use context providers, create them within a Client Component and then render them at the root level of your Server Component. This way, the context can be consumed by all Client Components throughout your app.

## Client Components

### Moving Client Components Down the Tree

To optimize the size of your Client JavaScript bundle, consider moving Client Components deeper into your component tree. Instead of making the entire layout a Client Component, isolate interactive logic within Client Components, leaving the layout as a Server Component. This approach reduces the amount of JavaScript sent to the client.

### Passing Props from Server to Client Components (Serialization)

If you fetch data in a Server Component and want to pass it as props to Client Components, ensure that the data is serializable by React. If your data isn't serializable, consider fetching it on the client using a third-party library or via a Route Handler on the server.

## Interleaving Server and Client Components

When combining Server and Client Components in your application, it's helpful to visualize your UI as a tree of components. Starting with the root layout, which is typically a Server Component, you can render specific subtrees as Client Components by adding the `"use client"` directive.

Remember the following considerations when interleaving Server and Client Components:

- During the request-response lifecycle, your code moves from the server to the client, making a new request to the server if necessary.
- All Server Components are rendered first during a server request, including those nested inside Client Components. React uses a payload to reconcile Server and Client Components on the client.

### Supported Pattern: Passing Server Components to Client Components as Props

You can pass Server Components as props to Client Components. One common pattern is to use the `children` prop to create a slot in your Client Component, which can be filled with the result of a Server Component.

In this approach, Server and Client Components remain decoupled and can be rendered independently. The child Server Component can be rendered on the server long before the Client Component is rendered on the client.

Remember that you're not limited to the `children` prop; you can use any prop to pass JSX.

## Wrapping Up

Understanding when and how to use Server and Client Components in React is crucial for building efficient applications. By following these composition patterns and best practices, you can harness the power of Server Components while optimizing the performance and maintainability of your React applications. Whether you're sharing data, isolating server-only code, or interleaving components, these patterns will help you make informed architectural decisions for your next React project.

# Understanding Next.js Runtimes: Node.js vs. Edge

When building web applications with Next.js, one critical aspect to consider is the runtime environment where your code executes. In the context of Next.js, a runtime refers to the set of libraries, APIs, and functionalities available to your code during execution. Next.js offers two main runtime environments on the server: the **Node.js Runtime** (which is the default) and the **Edge Runtime**. In this blog post, we'll explore the key differences between these runtimes and when to choose one over the other.

## Node.js Runtime: The Default Choice

The **Node.js Runtime** is the default environment for Next.js applications. It provides access to all Node.js APIs and is compatible with packages from the Node.js ecosystem. This runtime offers great flexibility, but it's essential to be aware of its characteristics:

- **Cold Boot**: When a Node.js runtime starts, it can have a slower "cold boot" time, which means it takes a bit longer to initialize.
- **HTTP Streaming**: Node.js supports HTTP streaming, which allows for efficient loading of UI and streaming content to clients.
- **IO Operations**: Node.js can handle various IO operations efficiently.
- **Scalability**: While it is scalable, it may not be as suitable for extremely high loads compared to the Edge Runtime.
- **Security**: Node.js provides normal security levels for your application.
- **Latency**: The latency in the Node.js Runtime is normal, neither particularly high nor low.
- **npm Packages**: You can use any npm package that relies on Node.js APIs.
- **Static Rendering**: Node.js supports static rendering, making it a good choice for generating static pages.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: It also supports dynamic rendering with server components.
- **Data Revalidation**: Data revalidation using the `fetch` function is possible in this runtime.

Using the Node.js Runtime gives you the full power of Node.js, but it comes with the responsibility of managing, scaling, and configuring your infrastructure if you deploy your Next.js application to a Node.js server.

## Edge Runtime: Speed and Limitations

The **Edge Runtime** is a lightweight subset of Node.js APIs available in Next.js. It is ideal for scenarios where speed and low latency are critical. Here are some key characteristics of the Edge Runtime:

- **Cold Boot**: Edge Runtime offers instant cold boot, making it exceptionally fast to start.
- **HTTP Streaming**: Similar to Node.js, Edge Runtime also supports HTTP streaming.
- **IO Operations**: Instead of traditional IO operations, Edge Runtime relies on the `fetch` function for data retrieval.
- **Scalability**: The Edge Runtime is highly scalable, making it suitable for high loads.
- **Security**: It offers high security levels.
- **Latency**: Edge Runtime has the lowest latency, which is crucial for delivering content quickly.
- **npm Packages**: It supports only a smaller subset of npm packages due to its lightweight nature.
- **Static Rendering**: Edge Runtime does not support static rendering.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: It supports dynamic rendering with server components.
- **Data Revalidation**: Data revalidation using the `fetch` function is possible in this runtime.

The key advantage of the Edge Runtime is its speed, with instant cold boots and minimal resource usage. However, it has limitations, such as a size limit for code execution (between 1 MB and 4 MB, depending on your deployment infrastructure). This size limit includes imported packages, fonts, and files.

## When to Choose Each Runtime

### Node.js Runtime
- Choose the Node.js Runtime when you need access to the full range of Node.js APIs and npm packages.
- Opt for Node.js if you're building a complex application that requires extensive server-side processing.
- Consider Node.js when static rendering is a requirement for your project.

### Edge Runtime
- Use the Edge Runtime when speed and low latency are paramount, such as delivering personalized content quickly.
- Opt for Edge when you need to handle high loads efficiently.
- Consider Edge for scenarios where code execution size limitations are acceptable.

## Switching Runtimes in Next.js

By default, the `app` directory in your Next.js project uses the Node.js Runtime. However, Next.js allows you to switch runtimes on a per-route basis. You can specify the runtime for individual route segments by declaring a variable called `runtime` and exporting it in your route files. The variable should have a value of either `'nodejs'` or `'edge'`. Additionally, you can define `runtime` on a layout level, making all routes under the layout run on the Edge Runtime.

It's crucial to make an informed decision about which runtime to use for each part of your application to achieve the right balance between speed, scalability, and functionality.

In summary, Next.js offers two powerful runtimes—Node.js and Edge—with distinct characteristics. Your choice of runtime should align with the specific needs of your project, whether it's maximizing speed, utilizing extensive Node.js capabilities, or finding a balance between the two. Understanding these runtimes allows you to optimize your Next.js application for performance and functionality.
