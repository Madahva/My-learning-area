# BEM
BEM (which stands for Block-Element-Modifier) is a naming convention standard for CSS class names. It has fairly wide adoption and is immensely useful in writing CSS that is easier to read, understand, and scale.

BEM naming provides three specific benefits:

- It communicates purpose or function
- It communicates component structure
- It sets a consistent low-level of specificity for styling selectors
