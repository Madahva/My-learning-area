Media queries are used to conditionally apply styles 

A media query is an CSS functionality that allows the content of a Web page to adapt to the type of media that the page is being rendered in, such as a computer screen or that of a phone or tablet. It is called responsive web design. 

Responsive web design is when you use CSS and HTML to resize, hide, shrink, enlarge, or move the content to make it look good on any screen.
