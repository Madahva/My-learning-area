	# The box model


All HTML elements can be considered as boxes.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: **margins**, **borders**, **padding**, and the actual **content**.

In CSS we broadly have two types of boxes â€” **block** boxes and **inline** boxes. These characteristics refer to how the box behaves in terms of page flow and in relation to other boxes on the page.

You can change the display modes with the display property.
