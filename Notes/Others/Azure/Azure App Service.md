## Continuous integration/deployment support

Azure Web App service provides comprehensive support for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).

Azure Web App service supports continuous integration and deployment by integrating with popular source control systems, providing build and deployment pipelines, supporting deployment slots for staging and testing, offering the Deployment Center for streamlined setup, and enabling automated deployments triggered by repository events. This allows for seamless integration and automation of the build, test, and deployment processes for web applications.

## Built-in autoscale support (automatic scale-out based on real-world load)

The ability to scale up/down or scale out is baked into the web app. Depending on the web app's usage, you can scale your app up/down by increasing/decreasing the resources of the underlying machine that is hosting your web app. Resources can be number of cores or the amount of RAM available.

Scaling out, on the other hand, is the ability to increase the number of machine instances that are running your web app.
